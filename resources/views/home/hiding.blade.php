      <p>Hiding in Plain Sight – our exciting new heritage project, produced in collaboration with illustrator Adam Allsuch Boardman – is now live!
      <p>The interactive microsite allows users to navigate the city and visit the locations of dozens of past cinemas, many of which have survived and are still visible today.<p>
